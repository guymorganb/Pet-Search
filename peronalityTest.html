    <!-- This document needs structure and style: to make this wrok we will need:
        A:: make an html which is structure to display structure of the page where the personality test will take place.
            -- this page will be load and will use Modal to performa the personality test (sufficing the Modal requirement of the assignment)
            -- this page will be dynamically generated using JavaScript populating the data from the personality test API(unless i can get it to work)
            -- reason for making this page separate is simply becasue a lot of action will occur here and it will be easier to have a clean page to operate with
            -- this page will need its own CSS style sheet see ./assets/personalityTestStyles.css
            -- see examples of design in ./examplesForDesign
